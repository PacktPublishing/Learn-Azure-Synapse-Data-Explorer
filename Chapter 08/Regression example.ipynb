To test this notebook and make sure everything works, it’s a good idea to work with a small subset of your data to avoid the increased costs of data retrieval, and the compute costs. This code reduces the Spark DataFrame to 1% of its size. \n",

For example, the DeviceData column, which is a JSON column that contains the device’s ID and name, is not relevant to determining the device’s core temperature. Therefore, we’re selecting here only columns that we think may help train our regression model. We will also produce three new columns that store the hour, day of month, and day of week of the telemetry event. Having this type of data separate on new columns can sometimes help find insights related to a certain fixed time or day an event happens. \n",
        "- Split the data in training and validation sets: when you train models, you want to separate a portion of your data to train the model and use another portion of your data to validate the model accuracy (by checking predicted data against real values). In this example, we will set 80% of the available data to the training set, and 20% to the validation set. \n",
