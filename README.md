**A guide to building real-time analytics solutions to unlock log and telemetry data**

## What is this book about?
Large volumes of data are generated daily from applications, websites, IoT devices, and other free-text, semi-structured data sources. Azure Synapse Data Explorer helps you collect, store, 
and analyze such data, and work with other analytical engines, such as Apache Spark, to develop advanced data science projects and maximize the value you extract from data.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Integrate Data Explorer pools with all other Azure Synapse services
* Create Data Explorer pools with Azure Synapse Studio and Azure Portal
* Ingest, analyze, and serve data to users using Azure Synapse pipelines
* Integrate Power BI and visualize data with Synapse Studio
* Configure Azure Machine Learning integration in Azure Synapse
* Manage cost and troubleshoot Data Explorer pools in Synapse Analytics
* Secure Synapse workspaces and grant access to Data Explorer pools

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a data engineer, data analyst, or business analyst working with unstructured data and looking to learn how to maximize the value of such data, this book is for you. 
If you already have experience working with Azure Synapse and want to incorporate unstructured data into your data science project, you’ll also find plenty of useful information in this book. 
To maximize your learning experience, familiarity with data and performing simple queries using SQL or KQL is recommended. 

Basic knowledge of Python will help you get more from the examples.	
With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).

### Software and Hardware List

To maximize your learning experience, you should have a basic understanding of concepts around
data integration, data retrieval, and building basic data visualizations. Previous experience with SQL,
KQL, and Python is not required, but it will help you understand the concepts in the code examples
more quickly.
